\chapter{Background}
In this chapter, we will look into heterogeneous systems and the processing units frequently used in such systems. While heterogeneous systems power heterogeneous computing algorithms and can consist of processing units of all kinds. This thesis focus lies on Central Processing Units (CPUs) and Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) as the processing power of a heterogeneous system.
After that the theoretical background of Causal Structure Learning and the PC-algorithm will be explained, which we will connect to the possible execution on heterogeneous systems.
