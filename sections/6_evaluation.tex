\chapter{Evaluation}
% Performance improvements could be shown for level 2 and 3
% But only in specific contexts
%   - doees not scale well
%   - perfect for situations, where the GPU gets to its (memory) limit
% 
% Workstealing better than pre-balanced through dynamic nature
%   - does not have to be tuned
% Pre balanced is very hard to tune (might be even harder for different datasets)
%   - perforamnce characteristic has to be look at while tuning
%   - what is perforamnce? Too complex to decide. Just heuristics, which could not be portable to other systems
%   - The bigger the dataset, the worse to tune (long runtimes)
%   - Tuning after execution does not help, because the tuned values are not really reusable
% Hardware impacts execution times alot (SMT)
% Has to decided for each system if applying is worth
% Multithreading not efficient (could be fixed)

% Topic has to be further look into but seems promising
