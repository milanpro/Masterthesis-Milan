\chapter{Experiments}
To test the proposed approaches and their implementations a stable experiment environment is used. The dataset the experiments use for computation is based on the dataset used in the experiments of Perscheid et al. \cite{perscheidIntegrativeGeneSelection2018}. The dataset is taken from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). 
% - Explain dataset used for testing (TCGA)
%   - Variable size
%   - how sampled
%   - paper (perscheid etc)
% - Show delos as a testing machine
%   - Intel Xeon 
%   - Nvidia  V100
%   - specs
%   - numa nodes
% - Show AC922
%   - Explain why power9 + V100 special
%   - ATS: Malloc is enough
%   - Faster interconnect NVLINK
%     - Comparison between interconnects
%   - Other pros : atomics etc
%   - Explain why this should affect my performance
%   - Compare Power9 to Intel Xeon
% - Show iteration measurements per level
%   - show how many tests and iterations have to be done

% - Measurements of GPU only Code

% - Measurements of Pre-balanced
%   - With, without migrating edges
%   - Different thresholds
%   - Different Dataset sizes
%   - Different omp scheduling methods
%   - Pinning on NUMA nodes
%   - Delos vs AC922
% - Measurements of Workstealing
%   - With, without migrating edges
%   - Different Dataset sizes
%   - Pinning on NUMA nodes
%   - Delos vs AC922

% - Measurements with different Datasets
%   - Iterations
%   - Workstealing Numa 0
%   - Prebalanced
%   - GPU only
